# PyBer-Analysis
Ride Sharing App
PyBer Ride Share Analysis Project

This project involves performing a 3 month analysis for PyBer, a ride share company whose scope of routes are spread among urban, suburban and rural riders. As part of this analysis, following needs to be performed: 

1. Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
o	The total number of rides for each city type.
o	The average fares for each city type.
o	The total number of drivers for each city type.

2. Create charting that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.


Analysis Results

As can be seen by the analysis performed, it is apparent that the Urban routes are easily the most profitable for PyBer based on results displayed on the following table:

The number of Urban rides, drivers and Total Fares easily provide the majority of the revenue generated by PyBer. A reason for this may be that the Urban Average Fare per Ride is less and may be more competitive as compared to other ride share companies or alternative forms of transportation. 

A line chart that displays the above results was generated by our analysis and can be seen here:

Fares tend to rise for all 3 venues of business (Rural, Suburban and Urban) from the January-March 
time period and dropping slightly after that point.  Reasons for that are unclear; this may be due to 
weather or other seasonal factors.

Challenge Summary

The results from this analysis provide only short term results; a larger time frame, perhaps over a year 
time frame would be more informative.

Other factors to consider in a longer term study would be:

1.	The amount of advertising done among the 3 market segments. Would increased
    advertising yield better results among Rural and Suburban routes?
2.	The number of drivers; would a larger number of city drivers yield better revenue results?
3.	 Would the price per ride need to be adjusted within the Rural and Suburban routes?
